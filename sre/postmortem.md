    * Should be shared withing an organization.
    * Can be used as a training material
1. Content:
    * What went wrong
    * What the impact of the issue was
    * How you tracked down the problem
    * How you fixed the problem
    * How to prevent it from happening again.
1. Conclusion:
    * What could have gone terribly wrong?
    * How can we avoid such issues in the future?
