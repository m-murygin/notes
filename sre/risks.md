# Managing Risks

## Risks definitions
1. Define all the SLO risks. The sources:
    * failures in the past could be a good source of data
    * analyzing all the possible hazards.
1. Prioritize risk by the following equation:
    ```
    Risk = probability * impact
    ```

    * probability => time to failure
    * impact => service downtime
1. With the above convention we could measure risk as **Bad Minutes / Year**


## Reducing risks
1. Perform education
1. Perform "wheel of misfortune"
1. Train the staff by injecting real bug in production system.
